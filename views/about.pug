            | I’m a Software Engineer, working mainly on web and mobile apps. I taught myself how to make websites 18 years ago as a hobbiest coder.   
            | More recently I enrolled into a coding bootcamp called Actualize Coding Bootcamp as well as an Fullstack Javascript TechDegree from Treehouse. 
            | I created several projects in these programs to showcase all that I learned and you can see them on the home page. 
            | I am currently looking for a full time software developer role that is remote. I would love to work on a team that has sustainability in mind and loves new challenges.
