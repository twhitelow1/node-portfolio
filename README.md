# node-portfolio

## About
This is my Unit 6 project for my Treehouse TechDegree. I use Node, Express, and Pug to create a static server that serves my personal portfolio. 

## Getting Started
To get the Node Server running locally:
- Clone this repo
- ```npm install``` to install all required dependencies
- ```npm start``` to start the local server
